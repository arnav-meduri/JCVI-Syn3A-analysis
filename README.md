## Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-Syn3A analysis

### Goal
Computational Elucidation and Characterization of Protein-Protein Interactions in the Minimal Proteome of Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-Syn3A

Explore the genetic architecture of a minimal cell using protein sequences. Minimal cells are fundamentally 
interesting from the view of thinking about abiogenesis as well as for engineering cells
We will try to use the sequences of individual proteins in the cell to intuit higher level
organization of those proteins into protein complexes. 

By comparing very large collections of proteins we can detect these correlations and use them to infer not only proteins 
interact but exactly where on the protein the interaction occurs.

### Mycoplasma mycoides JCVI-Syn3A
Mycoplasma mycoides is a bacterium that lacks a cell wall and is considered to possess the smallest genome
of a free living organism. It can be grown in a chemically defined synthetic medium. In nature, it is a minor pathogen. 
It was the second cellular genome to be sequenced. The same group that sequenced it later made it the first genome
to be completely resynthesized and booted up as a living cell. Later, the group did extensive work to identify 
non-essential genes (genes that could be removed and still have a living cell). The final version of the genome from 
this systematic reduction process is JCVI-Syn3A.
